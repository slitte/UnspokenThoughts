# UnspokenThougts

**Every text message in the mesh is an unspoken thought â€”  
fleeting like a shooting star, passing silently through the network.**

This project transforms live messages from the Meshtastic network into a visual, interactive installation.  
Each message triggers a shooting star in a stylized sky, powered by open hardware and open source software.

Itâ€™s not about content. Itâ€™s about presence.

- Real-time messages become light.
- Nodes become stars.
- The mesh becomes alive.

Built with Rust, visualized with Godot, powered by the people.
