# UnspokenThoughts ðŸŒŒ

**Every text message in the mesh is an unspoken thought â€”  
fleeting like a shooting star, passing silently through the network.**

This project transforms real-time messages from the [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org) network into an interactive visual installation.

- ðŸ“¡ **Mesh messages** become **shooting stars**
- ðŸ’¡ **Nodes** become **stars in the sky**
- ðŸŒ€ The **network becomes alive**

Built with:
- ðŸ¦€ Rust (serial decoding, event routing, TCP interface)
- ðŸŽ® Godot (real-time 2D/3D visualization)
- ðŸ§© Open hardware & open protocols
